# Portfolio Website
## Introduction
Welcome to the Portfolio Website project! This is a personal website project that is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements to potential employers. It also serves as an online professional profile (besides my own LinkedIn page). 

This website is developed using modern web technologies such as React.js to make use of reusable components and state management. For styling purposes, Tailwind CSS is used to style the components and enable responsive design. And then, Vite is used as the development server and build tool which enables fast and efficient workflow.
